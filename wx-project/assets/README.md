# Weather Py

In this project, I used Python requests, APIs, JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" Does the data support the idea that it simply gets hotter?

## WeatherPy

In this project, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random cities across the world with varyious distances from the equator. I obtained the cities and weather with the [citipy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Comparisons Used

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
