   <h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
   <p>The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you&#39;ve decided
      to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you&#39;ll be acting as Chief Data
      Strategist for the company. In this role, you&#39;ll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new
      opportunities for market differentiation.</p>
   <p><img src="Images/Ride.png" alt="Ride"></p>
   <p>You&#39;ve since been given access to the company&#39;s complete recordset of rides. This contains information
      about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city
      type.</p>
   <p>Build a bubble chart that showcases the relationship between four key variables:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Average Fare (\$) Per City</li>
      <li>Total Number of Rides Per City</li>
      <li>Total Number of Drivers Per City</li>
      <li>City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In addition, produce the following pie charts:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>% of Total Fares by City Type</li>
      <li>% of Total Rides by City Type</li>
      <li>
         <p>% of Total Drivers by City Type</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>NOTE: Use the company color scheme (Gold, Light Sky Blue, and Light Coral) in producing your plot and pie
            charts.</p>
      </li>
   </ul>
